// your subconscious(or i call it unconscious) is far more strategic and powerfull than you ever imagine. problem is we don't use it. 
// It acts according to your beliefs. so believe in it. if you are not getting any answer to a question, 
// leave it to your unconscious(there is no mantra. just believe and leave it). be conscious. and it gives you the answer. 
// it can happen in many ways like in your dream, or like a flash of thought. or through your spoken words unwillingly. 
// or it may create or give you a physical situation which leads you to the answer.

// Without knowledge, intelligence is hollow. Learn as much as you can.
// Never mug up. Ask, search and read again and again till you understand a concept.
// Observe everything and everyone you see in routine life.
// Don't aim at scoring or answering, think with an aim to resolve a problem.
// Don't fear failure, give your solution to problems, keep trying until you succeed.
// Listen carefully before reacting.
// Intelligence is not restricted to a field, it's an attitude to understand everything you come across and apply the knowledge whenever needed.
// “Why?” This is how intelligent people understand concepts.
// Intelligent people make mistakes and learn key lessons, regretting is not for them.
// Intelligence is about fast thinking, and you can't think fast until you practise thinking. (Overthinking may be a character of an intelligent person.)
// If you are not born intelligent, it doesn't mean that you wouldn't die intelligent, and vice versa.

// ************************************************How to identify when I am bored***********************************************************

// Restlessness: Feeling fidgety, like you can't sit still or focus on a task.
// Lack of interest: Finding that you're not engaged or interested in what you're currently doing.
// Daydreaming: Frequently drifting off into unrelated thoughts or fantasies.
// Checking the time: Repeatedly looking at the clock or your watch, hoping time will pass more quickly.
// Procrastination: Avoiding tasks or responsibilities because you find them uninteresting or unchallenging.
// Irritability: Becoming easily annoyed or frustrated with your current situation or surroundings.
// Lack of motivation: Feeling unenthusiastic or unmotivated to start or complete tasks.
// Increased phone or social media usage: Mindlessly scrolling through your phone or social media feeds to pass the time.
// Seeking distractions: Constantly searching for something to do, even if it's unproductive or unrelated to your goals.
// Physical cues: Yawning, sighing, or feeling physically tired despite not having expended much energy.
// If you notice these signs, it's a good indicator that you might be bored. Boredom can be an opportunity to explore new interests, set goals, or engage in activities that stimulate your mind and bring you a sense of fulfillment. It can also be a signal that you need a change in your routine or environment to prevent monotony.
